# AppletAnimation
Basic example with comments for animation in a Java Applet.

This uses special blocks not covered in the class/textbook, the try{} and catch(){} blocks. These are all part of Exceptions, which you can read a little bit about in Chapter 5.2. 

They're kind of like ** if(){}else(){} ** blocks in that they check for certain conditions before proceeding, but used more for debugging a program / properly designing it for failures.

To add this to your Eclipse, please make a new Java Project, and create 2 classes with the **exact same names** as the files in this repository.

Then, just go into each file in this repository, copy the code inside, and paste them into the corresponding class.
